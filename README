# Spring Boot Java Emby API Client

An alternative API client for Emby Media Server based on: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient.Java

## Main Differences from Official Client

 * Remove Andriod dependecies
 * Leverages Spring Boot
 * All API calls are syncronous


## NOTE: This API Client is in ALPHA (PRE) 
* Expect breaking changes!
* Jar is not hosted anywhere, will need to build from source and add the jar locally

## README to be fleshed out as Client is :)
